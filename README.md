## Description
This is a project that I decided to create to showcase my skills as a programmer, as well as to make it easier to send resumes to different companies for job hunting :)

## File structure
1. assets => 
   All images, styles, icons or fonts and others that are not related to the code go here
2. components => 
   Directories for sets of components, e.g. under the `Menu` directory, will have the implementation of the interface and functionality for the page menu
3. pages => 
   I store all pages here. Each page is a combination of all elements/components into a whole that is to be displayed to the user
